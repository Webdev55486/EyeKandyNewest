                            <h4>General tips and advice</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span>1. </span>Upload more than four photos.</li>
                                <li><span>2. </span>Make sure to change your profile photo every week or 2 weeks to spice up your profile.</li>
                                <li><span>3. </span>To get to the top you'll need to use as many of the available features as you can: Adobe encoder, HD Camera, a microphone and 5 star ratings (this is the most important and can get you to the #1 spot). </li>
                                <li><span>4. </span>Always treat your big tippers extra special by sending them mail on your performer dashboard and don't forget to let them know when you'll be on.</li>
                                <li><span>5. </span>Keep yourself clean and only use toys in private chat.</li>
                                <li><span>6. </span>Guys love different outfits and different toys, experiment with different outfits to find what works for you and invest in those. The more toys and outfits you have, the more shows you'll get.</li>
                                <li><span>7. </span>Experiment with different days and different times of day. Late Friday/Saturday night when the guys get back from drinking can be good. Weekends during the day time (esp. Sunday) are also good. Keep in mind what time it is in the US and UK; that is where most of your customers are from.</li>
                                <li><span>8. </span>A high internet speed is IMPORTANT, especially with the encoder. Playing youtube or streaming content will slow it down.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>How to put on a great show</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span>1. </span>Greet every single guy that comes in your room and talk to them like they are REAL people with feelings. Do not ask a guy to go private as soon as he comes into your room. These men want you to make them feel good.</li>
                                <li><span>2. </span>When in group chat, make sure the guys know that there are others in the room. If they want you to do something specific like phone, they need to go exclusive. Do not do a phone in a group chat, just talking to one guy. Your ratings may drop.</li>
                                <li><span>3. </span>Encourage tips but don't beg.</li>
                                <li><span>4. </span>Don't be too talkative because it stops privates, but keep in mind that some like to get to know a girl first.</li>
                                <li><span>5. </span>Donâ€™t be afraid to change your prices for private/exclusive because they will pay.</li>
                                <li><span>6. </span>Don't be afraid to use the ban function when idiots waste your time in free chat, it distracts you from actual paying customers.</li>
                                <li><span>7. </span>Don't tolerate beggars.</li>
                                <li><span>8. </span>Block the time-wasters. There IS a difference between guys who come in for conversation and who (eventually) will become a paying regular...they don't ask you for freebies, they don't hog the attention and they are actually okay to talk to and help the flow of conversation in the room.</li>
                                <li><span>9. </span>Respond to private messages even if the guy annoys you, don't be so quick to ban.</li>
                                <li><span>10. </span>Take advantage of exclusive chat (Make it at least a dollar more than your private chat).</li>
                                <li><span>11. </span>Always encourage gold.</li>
                                <li><span>12. </span>Although you have 29 seconds to get dressed its okay to position the cam up or down to freshen up.</li>
                                <li><span>13. </span>Beware that once you go private some customers may try to fool you trying to get everything pleasing to them for the free 30 seconds. We don't bill the customer until after 30 seconds keep track of the 30 seconds start off doing softcore sexy don't jump to anything hardcore till after the 30 seconds over. We protect cam models against chargebacks from customers, they will pay you once 30 seconds over.</li>
                                <li><span>14. </span>Don't be afraid to try something new! It's refreshing!</li>
                                <li><span>15. </span>If you don't want 30 second peepers, change your premium private rate to more than ur exclusive private rate.</li>
                                <li><span>16. </span>To keep excitement in your free chat, play some games with the customers, dance to your favourite music, enable Gold-Chat Party (if u have it).</li>
                                <li><span>17. </span>Make sure to set a schedule in your profile and STICK to it, you will get more regular customers that way.</li>
                                <li><span>18. </span>Work for that 5-star rating by encouraging customers who paid to write a comment and rate u after their show.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li><span>1. </span>Twitter is a great way to expand your clientele. Some of our models have a following of over 50,000 people! It's a great way to tell thousands of followers when your online.</li>
                                <li><span>2. </span>When creating your account, we strongly recommend you use your performer name and remember to never give out any personal information.</li>
                                <li><span>3. </span>Be creative with your hastags to gain more followers. A good example for your tweets would be: </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="whightColor m-t-15">Include a teaser photo in your tweet and remember to promote your webcam link. (You can shorten your links by using this free safe tool, <span><a href="https://bitly.com/" class="violet" target="_blank">bitly.com</a></span>).</p>

                            <h4>Techy Stuff</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span>1. </span>TUse a HD webcam, Get good lighting, get a fast internet connection so your cam doesn't jerk. I CANNOT stress this enough. Men are visual creatures. You do not want him to be just about to climax and your cam freeze.</li>
                                <li><span>2. </span>Turn on your microphone. Guys love to hear you. If you do not have a mic we highly recommend you get one.</li>
                                <li><span>3. </span>If your using a HD camera please download the HD Encoder, you will find more information about this on your performer platform. The encoder works best with a desktop and the settings the SM tells you to use might not work so well unless you have top notch internet.</li>
                            </ul>
